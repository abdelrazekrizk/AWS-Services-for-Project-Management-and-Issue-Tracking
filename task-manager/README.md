# Frontend Application
The frontend application is the user interface built using a framework like `React`, `Angular`, or `Vue.js`.

## Overview
This project focuses on developing the frontend application using `React` to interact with the backend via RESTful APIs. We will implement user authentication with Amazon Cognito and integrate all components together.

## Getting Started

To get started with this frontend application, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Project Structure

Organize your project structure by creating folders for:
- Components
- Services
- Context (for authentication state management)

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── SignIn.js
│   ├── SignUp.js
├── services/
│   └── apiService.js
├── context/
│   └── AuthContext.js
├── App.js
└── index.js
```

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Set Up the Frontend Application

1. **Choose a Framework**: For this example, we'll use React.
2. **Create a New React Application**:

```bash
   npx create-react-app task-manager
   cd task-manager
   npm start
```
# Installation of Required Packages

To get started, install the following required packages:

```bash
npm install axios amazon-cognito-identity-js
npm install react-router-dom@latest
npm install openid-client
```
# Step 2: Create API Service

## Create a Service for API Calls:
- Create a file named `apiService.js` in the `src/services` directory.

# Step 3: Implement User Authentication with Cognito

## Set Up Cognito User Pool:
- Go to the Amazon Cognito console, select your user pool, and note down the User Pool ID and App Client ID.

## Create Authentication Context:
- Create a new context for managing authentication state in `src/context/AuthContext.js`.

# Step 4: Create Components for User Authentication

## Create SignUp and SignIn Components:
- Create a `SignUp.js` component to handle user registration.
- Create a `SignIn.js` component to handle user login.

# Step 5: Create Main Application Component

## Create App Component:
- In `src/App.js`, set up routes for Sign Up and Sign In, and include the `AuthProvider`.

# Step 6: Test the Frontend Application

## Run the Application:
- Start the application using:
```bash
  npm start
```
## Navigate to the Sign Up and Sign In Pages
- Test user registration and login functionality.

## Test API Integration
- Once user authentication is working, you can add task management components (create, update, delete, get tasks) and use the `apiService.js` methods to interact with your API.

## Summary
At the end, you should have:
- A functional frontend application built with React.
- User authentication implemented using Amazon Cognito.
- Integration with the API Gateway for managing tasks.
