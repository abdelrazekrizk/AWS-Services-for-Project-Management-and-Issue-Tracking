## AWS Services
Leverage the following AWS services to build a robust project management and issue tracking system:
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Use it as your primary database to store tasks, user stories, and project information. Its flexible schema allows you to adapt as your needs change.
- **AWS Lambda**: Implement serverless functions to handle business logic for creating, updating, and retrieving tasks. This allows you to scale easily without managing servers.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Create RESTful APIs to interface between your frontend application and backend services. This will allow you to perform operations like adding or updating tasks through API calls.
- **Amazon S3**: Use S3 to store attachments and documents related to tasks. This provides secure and scalable storage for your files.
- **Amazon Cognito**: Implement user authentication and authorization using Amazon Cognito. This will help manage user accounts and permissions.
- **Amazon SNS**: Use Simple Notification Service (SNS) for sending notifications about task updates, deadlines, or comments.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitor application performance and set up alarms for any issues that arise.

## Set Up the Basic Infrastructure
1. **Create an AWS Account** (if you don't already have one).
2. **Create Amazon S3 Bucket**:
   - Set up an Amazon S3 bucket for storing attachments and documents related to tasks.
3. **Create a DynamoDB Table**:
   - Set up a DynamoDB table for storing tasks and projects.
4. **Set Up IAM Roles and Policies**:
   - Create IAM users with necessary permissions for accessing AWS services.
   - Create IAM roles for Lambda functions with permissions to access DynamoDB, S3, and other required services.
5. **Set Up AWS Lambda**:
   - Create initial Lambda functions for task management (e.g., create, update, delete).
6. **Set Up Amazon Cognito (for user authentication)**:
   - Create a Cognito User Pool for managing user sign-ups and logins.
7. **Create an API Gateway**:
   - Set up an API Gateway to expose endpoints for the Lambda functions.
8. **Create Amazon SNS Service**:
   - Set up an Amazon SNS topic for sending notifications about task updates, deadlines, or comments.


## Step 1: Create an AWS Account
If you don't have an AWS account, go to [AWS Signup](https://aws.amazon.com/signup/) and create a new account.

## Step 2: Create Amazon S3 Bucket

1. **Log in to AWS Management Console**:
   - Navigate to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).

2. **Access S3 Service**:
   - In the AWS Management Console, search for **S3** and select **S3** from the services dropdown.

3. **Create a New Bucket**:
   - Click on the **Create bucket** button.
   - **Configure Bucket Settings**:
     - **Bucket name**: Enter a unique name for your bucket (e.g., `my-project-management-bucket`).
     - **Region**: Select the AWS region where you want to create the bucket.
   - Click on **Create bucket** at the bottom of the page.

4. **Configure Bucket Permissions** (Optional):
   - After creating the bucket, you can set permissions as needed, such as allowing public access or restricting access to specific IAM roles.

## Step 3: Create a DynamoDB Table
- **Go to the DynamoDB Console**:
  - Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the DynamoDB service.
  - Click on "Create table."
- Configure Table Settings:
  - Table name: `Tasks`
  - Primary key:
    - Partition key: `UserId` (String)
    - Sort key: `TaskId` (String)
  - Click "Create" to finish the table setup.

**Note**:
- Write down the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table; you will need it to create IAM inline policy.

## Step 4: Set Up IAM Roles and Policies
- **Create IAM Users**:
  - Go to the IAM console.
  - Create IAM users for your development team with appropriate permissions (e.g., full access to DynamoDB, Lambda, and API Gateway).
- **Create IAM policy for Lambda**:
  - In the IAM console, within the automated role that was generated when creating Lambda.
  - Attach policies that allow access to DynamoDB and S3.
    - Example policies:
      - `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess`
      - `AmazonS3FullAccess`
    - You can customize the policy to include the target `DynamoDB Table` and `S3 bucket` by using IAM Inline policy.

## Step 5: Set Up AWS Lambda
1. **Go to the Lambda Console**:
   - Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Lambda service.
2. **Click on "Create function."**:
   - Select the option to create a new function.
3. **Configure Lambda Function**:
   - **Function name**: `CreateTask`
   - **Runtime**: Choose either Node.js or Python, depending on your preference.
   - **Permissions**: Choose the existing role you created earlier for Lambda.
4. **Add Function Code**:
   - Write the logic code for the Lambda function to create, update, delete, and retrieve tasks in DynamoDB. Hereâ€™s a simple example:
     - [CreateTask Lambda function](./Lambda%20Functions/CreateTask.js): This function will handle the creation of a new task in your DynamoDB table.
     - [UpdateTask Lambda function](./Lambda%20Functions/UpdateTask.js): This function updates an existing task in the DynamoDB table.
     - [DeleteTask Lambda function](./Lambda%20Functions/DeleteTask.js): This function deletes a task from the DynamoDB table.
     - [GetTask Lambda function](./Lambda%20Functions/GetTask.js): This function retrieves a specific task from the DynamoDB table.

   **Note**:
   - After AWS Lambda is set up, you will find that there is a Lambda role in the permission section under the configuration section: `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`.
   - Click on it; it will take you to the IAM console as we will set up IAM inline policy for DynamoDB and S3 later.

## Step 6: Set Up Amazon Cognito
1. **Go to the Cognito Console**:
 - Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Cognito service.
2. **Choose "Manage User Pools" and click "Create a user pool."**:
 - Follow the prompts to create a new user pool.
3. **Configure User Pool**:
 - **User pool name**: `TaskLinkerUserPool`
 - Configure attributes (e.g., email, password) based on your needs.
4. **Set Up App Client**:
 - Create an app client (e.g., `TaskLinkerApp`) and configure settings.
 - Note the App client ID and User Pool ID for later use.

## Step 7: Set Up API Gateway
1. **Go to the API Gateway Console**:
 - Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the API Gateway service.
2. **Choose "Create API" and select REST API**:
 - Follow the prompts to create a new REST API.
3. **Configure API Settings**:
 - **API name**: `TaskManagementAPI`
 - Click "Create API."
4. **Create Resources and Methods**:
 - Create resources for each functionality (e.g., `/tasks`).
 - For each resource, create methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and link them to the corresponding Lambda functions. For example:
  **Create API Gateway Endpoints for Each Function**:
   - **POST /tasks/update**: For updating tasks (linked to `UpdateTask`).
   - **DELETE /tasks/{UserId}/{TaskId}**: For deleting tasks (linked to `DeleteTask`).
   - **GET /tasks/{UserId}/{TaskId}**: For retrieving tasks (linked to `GetTask`).
5. **Deploy the API**:
 - Click on "Deploy API" and create a new stage (e.g., `dev`).

 ## Step 8: Create Amazon SNS Service


### Create a Standard SNS Topic

1. **Access the Amazon SNS Console**:
   - Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
