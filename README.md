# AWS Services for Project Management and Issue Tracking

## Objective
Create a scalable project management and issue tracking application using AWS services, allowing users to create, update, and manage tasks efficiently while providing features such as user authentication, file storage, and notifications.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, update, and delete tasks or issues.
- **User Stories**: Track user stories and their acceptance criteria.
- **Sprints and Backlogs**: Manage sprints, backlogs, and their associated tasks.
- **Comments and Collaboration**: Allow team members to comment on tasks for collaboration.
- **Attachments**: Enable file uploads for task-related documents.
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor the status of tasks (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on task progress, time spent, and team performance.
- **Notifications**: Send alerts for task updates, deadlines, and comments.

## Set Up the Basic Infrastructure

**AWS Services**
You can leverage the following AWS services to build a robust project management and issue tracking system:

- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Use it as your primary database to store tasks, user stories, and project information. Its flexible schema allows you to adapt as your needs change.
- **AWS Lambda**: Implement serverless functions to handle business logic for creating, updating, and retrieving tasks. This allows you to scale easily without managing servers.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Create RESTful APIs to interface between your frontend application and backend services. This will allow you to perform operations like adding or updating tasks through API calls.
- **Amazon S3**: Use S3 to store attachments and documents related to tasks. This provides secure and scalable storage for your files.
- **Amazon Cognito**: Implement user authentication and authorization using Amazon Cognito. This will help manage user accounts and permissions.
- **Amazon SNS**: Use Simple Notification Service (SNS) for sending notifications about task updates, deadlines, or comments.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitor application performance and set up alarms for any issues that arise.

## Frontend Application
The frontend application will be the user interface built using a framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js. It will interact with the backend via RESTful APIs.

## Set Up the Basic Infrastructure

1. **Create an AWS Account** (if you don't already have one).
2. **Set Up IAM Roles and Policies**:
   - Create IAM users with necessary permissions for accessing AWS services.
   - Create IAM roles for Lambda functions with permissions to access DynamoDB, S3, and other required services.
3. **Create a DynamoDB Table**:
   - Set up a DynamoDB table for storing tasks and projects.
4. **Set Up AWS Lambda**:
   - Create initial Lambda functions for task management (e.g., create, update, delete).
5. **Create an API Gateway**:
   - Set up an API Gateway to expose endpoints for the Lambda functions.
6. **Set Up Amazon Cognito (for user authentication)**:
   - Create a Cognito User Pool for managing user sign-ups and logins.



#### Create an AWS Account
If you don't have an AWS account, go to [AWS Signup](https://aws.amazon.com/signup/) and create a new account.

#### Set Up IAM Roles and Policies
- **Create IAM Users**:
  - Go to the IAM console.
  - Create IAM users for your development team with appropriate permissions (e.g., full access to DynamoDB, Lambda, and API Gateway).

- **Create IAM Roles for Lambda**:
  - In the IAM console, create a new role for Lambda.
  - Choose AWS Lambda as the trusted entity.
  - Attach policies that allow access to DynamoDB and S3.
    - Example policies:
      - `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess`
      - `AmazonS3FullAccess`
      - `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` (for logging to CloudWatch)

#### Create a DynamoDB Table
- Go to the DynamoDB Console.
- Click on "Create table."
- Configure Table Settings:
  - Table name: `Tasks`
  - Primary key:
    - Partition key: `UserId` (String)
    - Sort key: `TaskId` (String)
  - Click "Create" to finish the table setup.

#### Set Up AWS Lambda
- Go to the Lambda Console.
- Click on "Create function."
- Configure Lambda Function:
  - Function name: `CreateTask`
  - Runtime: Choose Node.js or Python (depending on your preference).
  - Permissions: Choose the existing role you created earlier for Lambda.
- **Add Function Code**: Write the logic code for the Lambda function.
